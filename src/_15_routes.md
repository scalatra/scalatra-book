Routes
======

In Scalatra, a route is an HTTP method paired with a URL matching pattern.

{pygmentize:: scala}
    get("/") {
      // show something
    }

    post("/") {
      // submit/create something
    }

    put("/") {
      // update something
    }

    delete("/") {
      // delete something
    }
{pygmentize}


### Route order

The first matching route is invoked.  Routes are matched from the bottom up.  _This is the opposite of Sinatra._
Route definitions are executed as part of a Scala constructor; by matching
from the bottom up, routes can be overridden in child classes.

### Named parameters

Route patterns may include named parameters:

{pygmentize:: scala}
    get("/hello/:name") {
      // Matches "GET /hello/foo" and "GET /hello/bar"
      // params("name") is "foo" or "bar"
      <p>Hello, {params("name")}</p>
    }
{pygmentize}

### Wildcards

Route patterns may also include wildcard parameters, accessible through the
`splat` key.

{pygmentize:: scala}
    get("/say/*/to/*) {
      // Matches "GET /say/hello/to/world"
      multiParams("splat") // == Seq("hello", "world")
    }

    get("/download/*.*) {
      // Matches "GET /download/path/to/file.xml"
      multiParams("splat") // == Seq("path/to/file", "xml")
    }
{pygmentize}

### Regular expressions

The route matcher may also be a regular expression.  Capture groups are
accessible through the `captures` key.

{pygmentize:: scala}
    get("""^\/f(.*)/b(.*)""".r) {
      // Matches "GET /foo/bar"
      multiParams("captures") // == Seq("oo", "ar")
    }
{pygmentize}

### Rails-like pattern matching

By default, route patterns parsing is based on Sinatra.  Rails has a similar,
but not identical, syntax, based on Rack::Mount's Strexp.  The path pattern
parser is resolved implicitly, and may be overridden if you prefer an
alternate syntax:

{pygmentize:: scala}
    import org.scalatra._

    class RailsLikeRouting extends ScalatraFilter {
      implicit override def string2RouteMatcher(path: String) =
        RailsPathPatternParser(path)

      get("/:file(.:ext)") { // matched Rails-style }
    }
{pygmentize}

### Path patterns in the REPL

If you want to experiment with path patterns, it's very easy in the REPL.

    scala> import org.scalatra.SinatraPathPatternParser
    import org.scalatra.SinatraPathPatternParser

    scala> val pattern = SinatraPathPatternParser("/foo/:bar")
    pattern: PathPattern = PathPattern(^/foo/([^/?#]+)$,List(bar))

    scala> pattern("/y/x") // doesn't match
    res1: Option[MultiParams] = None

    scala> pattern("/foo/x") // matches
    res2: Option[MultiParams] = Some(Map(bar -> ListBuffer(x)))

Alternatively, you may use the `RailsPathPatternParser` in place of the
`SinatraPathPatternParser`.

### Conditions

Routes may include conditions.  A condition is any expression that returns
Boolean.  Conditions are evaluated by-name each time the route matcher runs.

{pygmentize:: scala}
    get("/foo") {
      // Matches "GET /foo"
    }

    get("/foo", request.getRemoteHost == "127.0.0.1") {
      // Overrides "GET /foo" for local users
    }
{pygmentize}

Multiple conditions can be chained together.  A route must match all
conditions:

{pygmentize:: scala}
    get("/foo", request.getRemoteHost == "127.0.0.1", request.getRemoteUser == "admin") {
      // Only matches if you're the admin, and you're localhost
    }
{pygmentize}

No path pattern is necessary.  A route may consist of solely a condition:

{pygmentize:: scala}
    get(isMaintenanceMode) {
      <h1>Go away!</h1>
    }
{pygmentize}

### Actions

Each route is followed by an action.  An Action may return any value, which
is then rendered to the response according to the following rules:

`Array[Byte]` - If no content-type is set, it is set to `application/octet-stream`.
The byte array is written to the response's output stream.

`NodeSeq` - If no content-type is set, it is set to `text/html`.  The node
sequence is converted to a string and written to the response's writer.

`Unit` - This signifies that the action has rendered the entire response, and
no further action is taken.

`Any` - For any other value, if the content type is not set, it is set to
`text/plain`.  The value is converted to a string and written to the
response's writer.

This behavior may be customized for these or other return types by overriding
`renderResponse`.

### Parameter handling

Parameters become available to your actions through two methods: `multiParams`
and `params`.

`multiparams` are a result of merging the standard request params (query
string or post params) with the route parameters extracted from the route
matchers of the current route. The default value for an unknown param is the
empty sequence. Keys return `Seq`s of values.

`params` are a special, simplified view of `multiparams`, containing only the
head element for any known param, and returning the values as Strings.

#### A params example

As an example, let's hit a URL with a GET like this:

{pygmentize::}
  /articles/52?foo=uno&bar=dos&baz=three&foo=anotherfoo
{pygmentize}
(note that there are two "foo" keys in there)

Assuming there's a matching route at `/articles/:id`, we get the following
results inside the action:

{pygmentize:: scala}
  get("/articles/:id") {
    params("id") // => "52"
    params("foo") // => "uno" (discarding the second "foo" parameter value)
    params("unknown") // => generates a NoSuchElementException
    params.get("unknown") // => None - this is what Scala does with unknown keys in a Map

    multiParams("id") // => Seq("52")
    multiParams("foo") // => Seq("uno", "anotherfoo")
    multiParams("unknown") // => an empty Seq
  }
{pygmentize}

#### params.getOrElse

You can set defaults for parameter values easily by using `params.getOrElse`.

Let's say you wanted to require an :author name param, and set a :page value
to 1 by default. If you don't receive an :author, you want to stop execution.
You could do it like this:

{pygmentize:: scala}
get("/articles-by/:author/:page") {
  val author:String = params.getOrElse("author", halt(400))
  val page:Int = params.getOrElse("page", "1").toInt
  // now do stuff with your params
}
{pygmentize}

### Enabling Support for PUT and DELETE requests

Scalatra supports all of the HTTP verbs: `GET` and `POST`, which are supported by
browser clients, but also `PUT` and `DELETE`, which are not.

Many client libraries use non-standard but simple conventions to indicate
that they would like the request to be considered as a `PUT` or `DELETE` instead of
a POST: for example, jQuery adds a `X-HTTP-METHOD-OVERRIDE` header to the request.

Other clients and frameworks often indicate the same thing by adding a
`_method=put` or `_method=delete` parameter to a POST body.

Scalatra will look for these conventions on incoming requests and transform
the request method automatically if you add the `MethodOverride` trait into your
servlet or filter:

{pygmentize:: scala}
class MyFilter extends ScalatraFilter with MethodOverride {

  // POST to "/foo/bar" with params "id=2" and "_method=put" will hit this route:
  put("/foo/bar/:id") {
    // update your resource here
  }
}
{pygmentize}


### Request Filters

Scalatra offers a way for you too hook into the request chain of your
application via [Filters][filters].

Filters define two methods, `before` and `after` which both accept a
block to yield. Filters optionally take a URL pattern to match to the request.


#### before

The `before` method will let you pass a block to be evaluated **before** _each_
and _every_ route gets processed.

{pygmentize:: scala}
before() {
  MyDb.connect
  contentType="text/html"
}

get("/") {
  val list = MyDb.findAll()
  templateEngine.layout("index.ssp", list)
}
{pygmentize}

In this example, we've set up a `before` filter to connect using a contrived
`MyDb` module, and set the `contentType` for all requests to `text/html`.

#### after

The `after` method lets you pass a block to be evaluated **after** _each_ and
_every_ route gets processed.

{pygmentize:: scala}
after() {
  MyDb.disconnect
}
{pygmentize}

As you can see from this example, we're asking the `MyDB` module to
disconnect after the request has been processed.

### Pattern Matching

Filters optionally take a pattern to be matched against the requested URI
during processing. Here's a quick example you could use to run a contrived
`authenticate!` method before accessing any "admin" type requests.

{pygmentize:: scala}
before("/admin/*") {
  basicAuth
}

after("/admin/*") {
  user.logout
}
{pygmentize}

[filters]: http://www.scalatra.org/stable/book#Request_Filters

### Processing order

Route actions, errors and filters run in the following order:

1. `before` filters.
2. Routes and actions.
3. If an exception is thrown during the `before` filter or route actions, it is
   passed to the `errorHandler` function, and its result becomes the action result.
4. `after` filters.
5. The response is rendered.


### Handlers

Handlers are top-level methods available in Scalatra to take care of common HTTP
routines.

#### Redirects

There is a handler for redirection:

{pygmentize:: scala}
get("/"){
  redirect("/someplace/else")
}
{pygmentize}

This will return a redirect response, with HTTP status 302, pointing to
`/someplace/else`.

_Caution:_ `redirect` is implemented as a HaltException.  You probably don't
want to catch it in an action.

Although there's no built-in handler for permanent redirects, if you'd like to
do a 301 permanent redirect, you can do something like this:

{pygmentize:: scala}
halt(status = 301, headers = Map("Location" -> "http://example.org/"))
{pygmentize}

#### Halting

To immediately stop a request within a filter or route:

{pygmentize:: scala}
halt()
{pygmentize}

You can also specify the [HTTP status][statuses]:

[statuses]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

{pygmentize:: scala}
halt(403)
{pygmentize}

Or the status and the body:

{pygmentize:: scala}
halt(403, <h1>Go away!</h1>)
{pygmentize}

Or even the HTTP status reason and headers.  For more complex invocations, it
is recommended to use named arguments:

{pygmentize:: scala}
halt(status = 403,
     reason = "Forbidden",
     headers = Map("X-Your-Mother-Was-A" -> "hamster",
                   "X-And-Your-Father-Smelt-Of" -> "Elderberries"),
     body = <h1>Go away or I shall taunt you a second time!</h1>)
{pygmentize}

The `reason` argument is ignored unless `status` is not null.  If you don't pass
arguments for `status`, `reason`, or `body`, those parts of the response will
be left unchanged.

_Caution:_ `halt` is implemented as a HaltException.  You probably don't want
to catch it in an action.

#### Passing

A route can punt processing to the next matching route using `pass()`.  Remember,
unlike Sinatra, routes are matched from the bottom up.

{pygmentize:: scala}
get("/guess/*") {
  "You missed!"
}

get("/guess/:who") {
  params("who") match {
    case "Frank" => "You got me!"
    case _ => pass()
  }
}
{pygmentize}

The route block is immediately exited and control continues with the next
matching route.  If no matching route is found, the `notFound` handler is
invoked.

#### `notFound`

The `notFound` handler allows you to execute code when there is no matching
route for the current request's URL.

The default behavior is:

{pygmentize:: scala}
notFound {
  <h1>Not found. Bummer.</h1>
}
{pygmentize}

What happens next differs slightly based on whether you've set your application
up using ScalatraServlet or ScalatraFilter.

* _ScalatraServlet_: sends a 404 response
* _ScalatraFilter_: passes the request to the servlet filter chain, which may
  then throw a 404 or decide to do something different with it.
