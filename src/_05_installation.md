Installation
============

### Installation using `giter8`

The simplest way to get started with Scalatra is to generate a project with
[giter8](http://github.com/n8han/giter8).

Running `g8 scalatra/scalatra-sbt` will check out a pre-built application 
skeleton for you (from Github), and ask you some questions about your 
application:

{pygmentize::}
$ g8 scalatra/scalatra-sbt
> organization [com.example]: 
> package [com.example.app]: 
> name [scalatra-sbt-prototype]: 
> servlet_name [MyScalatraServlet]: 
> scala_version [2.9.1]: 
> version [0.1.0-SNAPSHOT]: 
{pygmentize}

`organization`: Used for publishing.  Should be the reverse of a domain 
name you control.  If you don''t own a domain, `com.github.username` is a
popular choice.  

`package`: All Scala code belongs in a package.  The [Scala Style
Guide](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html#packages)
recommends that your packages start with your organization.  This convention is
used across multiple JVM languages and gives your project a globally unique
namespace.

`name`: The name of your project.  g8 will generate a project into a
folder of this name, and the artifacts you publish will be based on this name.

`servlet_name`: the name of your servlet.

`scala_version`: The version of Scala your project is built with.  When in
doubt, use the default.

`version`: The version number of your project.  This is entirely up to you,
but we like [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

### Installation using `git clone`

For those who prefer not to install giter8, an equivalent prototype project is
maintained on GitHub:

{pygmentize::}
$ git clone http://github.com/scalatra/scalatra-sbt-prototype.git
{pygmentize}

You will need to manually update organization, name, and version in `build.sbt`.

### Understanding Scalatra Dependencies

The `build.sbt` file defines the libraries which your application will depend on.

{pygmentize:: scala}
organization := "org.example"

name := "blapp"

version := "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"

scalaVersion := "2.9.1"

seq(webSettings :_*)

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.scalatra" %% "scalatra" % "2.0.4",
  "org.scalatra" %% "scalatra-scalate" % "2.0.4",
  "org.scalatra" %% "scalatra-specs2" % "2.0.4" % "test",
  "ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.0.0" % "runtime",
  "org.eclipse.jetty" % "jetty-webapp" % "7.5.4.v20111024" % "container",
  "javax.servlet" % "servlet-api" % "2.5" % "provided"
)

resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
{pygmentize}

If your project depends on any additional libraries, you may add any other 
dependencies you wish into the `libraryDependencies` section.

The default dependencies are:

`scalatra`: This is the core Scalatra module, and is required to run the framework. 

`scalatra-scalate`: This integrates with [Scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org), 
a template engine supporting multiple template formats.  This is optional, but 
highly recommended for any app requiring templating.

`scalatra-specs2`: This integrates the [Specs2][specs2] testing libraries. 

`logback-classic`: Basic logging functionality, courtesy of [Logback][qos-ch].

`jetty-webapp`: This is the embedded servlet container used by the web plugin.  
Your application should be portable to any servlet container supporting at least
the 2.5 specification.

`servlet-api`: Required for building your app.  It is placed in the 
provided configuration so that it is not bundled with your application.  
Your servlet container will provide this at deployment time.

### Building

The prototype application uses [sbt >= 0.10](http://github.com/harrah/xsbt) 
for its build system. 

Enter your application's top-level directory and type `sbt`, and the application will
build.

For info installing and running sbt on your system, see [the sbt website][sbt-site].

Running in Development
======================

### Automatic Code Reloading

Restarting an application manually after every code change is both slow and
painful. It can easily be avoided by using a tool for automatic code reloading.

SBT will allow you to [signal a restart of the application when it detects
code changes](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Triggered-Execution). The
syntax for restarting includes adding `~` in front of the command you want to
re-execute.  To recompile and reload your application automatically with
xsbt-web-plugin 0.2.10, run the following:

{pygmentize::}
$ sbt
> container:start
> ~ ;copy-resources;aux-compile
{pygmentize}
