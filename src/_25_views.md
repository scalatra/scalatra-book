Views
=====

Scalatra can render views in three main ways. 

1. Inline HTML
1. Using Scalate directly
1. Using ScalateSupport helpers, with a bit more "magic"

### Inline HTML

The simplest method of rendering a view is by using inline HTML:
{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  contentType="text/html"

  <html>
  <head><title>Test</title></head>
  <body>Test Body for {uri("/")}</body>
  </html>
}
{pygmentize}

Note the use of the `{uri("/")}`, which renders Scala code within the inlined
view. 

### Scalate

Scalatra can use the incredibly powerful templating engine, 
[Scalate][scalate]. It is designed to be a "thin interface" for frameworks 
that want to support multiple template engines.

[scalate]: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/user-guide.html

Some of Scalate's all-star features include:

*   Custom template evaluation scopes / bindings
*   Ability to pass locals to template evaluation
*   Support for passing a block to template evaluation for "yield"
*   Backtraces with correct filenames and line numbers
*   Template file caching and reloading

Scalate includes support for some of the best engines available, such as
[SSP][ssp], [SCAML][scaml], [Mustache][mustache] and [Jade][jade].

[ssp]: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html
[scaml]: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/scaml-reference.html
[mustache]: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/mustache.html
[jade]: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/jade.html

All you need to get started is `Scalate`, which is included in Scalatra. Views
by default look in the `views` directory in your application root.

There are two ways to use Scalate. Both of them require you to extend your 
servlet with `ScalateSupport`:
{pygmentize:: scala}
class YourServlet extends ScalatraServlet with ScalateSupport {
  // your class here
}
{pygmentize}

### Using Scalate directly

Scalate can be called directly, using the 
`templateEngine.layout("templateName")` method, like this:

{pygmentize:: scala}
get("/") {
  templateEngine.layout("index.ssp")
  // renders webapp/index.ssp
  // OR look in a sub-directory

  templateEngine.layout("/dogs/index.ssp")
  // would instead render webapp/dogs/index.ssp
}
{pygmentize}

When using Scalate directly, Scalatra will look for your template files
in the `webapp` folder of your application (which is found under `src/main/`
in the project tree). 

Another default convention of Scalatra is the layout, which automatically 
looks for a `webapp/layout` template file to render before loading any 
other views. In the case of using `SSP`, your `webapp/layout/default.ssp` 
would look something like this:

{pygmentize:: html}
<%@ var yield: String %> 
<html>
  <head>..</head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
{pygmentize}

### ScalateSupport helpers

The second way of using Scalate is to use the ScalateSupport helpers, which
are a bit more "magic" than calling Scalate directly.

Basic usage:
{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  contentType="text/html"

  layoutTemplate("/WEB-INF/views/index.ssp")
}
{pygmentize}

When using `layoutTemplate`, you *must* prefix your view paths with a relative `/` 
character. So, `layoutTemplate("/WEB-INF/views/foo.ssp")` is good, `layoutTemplate("WEB-INF/views/foo.ssp`
will fail. 

Rendering with a different layout:
{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  contentType="text/html"

  layoutTemplate("/WEB-INF/views/index.ssp", "layout" -> "/WEB-INF/layouts/app.ssp")
}
{pygmentize}

Each possible kind of Scalate template (mustache, scaml, jade, ssp) has a
corresponding helper which can be used to find the template file, without a
suffix, and without the `WEB-INF/views` part of the path. The above example can be 
written as:

{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  contentType="text/html"

  ssp("/index", "layout" -> "WEB-INF/layouts/app.ssp")
}
{pygmentize}

When using the scalate helper methods, it is not required to having a leading `/`, so 
`ssp("index")` would work just as well as `ssp("/index")`.

Passing parameters

Parameters may be passed to your templates using a Seq(String, Any) after the 
path to the template file. The simplest example might look like this:

{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  contentType="text/html"

  layoutTemplate("/WEB-INF/views/index.ssp", "foo" -> "uno", "bar" -> "dos")
}
{pygmentize}

Putting it all together, in a scaml example (alternatively use mustache, ssp, 
or jade):
{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  contentType="text/html"

  scaml("/index", "layout" -> "WEB-INF/layouts/app.scaml", "foo" -> "uno", "bar" -> "dos")
}
{pygmentize}

### Layouts

The `layout` key is somewhat special, as it's used by scalate to identify the 
layout file, which wraps a standard layout around the output for the current
action. 

If you want, you can set off your `layout` parameter from the others, perhaps
by doing something like this (in jade this time):

{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  contentType="text/html"

  jade("/index",("layout" -> "WEB-INF/layouts/app.jade"), "foo" -> "uno", "bar" -> "dos")
}
{pygmentize}

Default layouts

Scalatra sets a default layout at `WEB-INF/layouts/default.xxxx` (where xxxx 
is one of the scalate template types). If you are using ssp, for instance, and
you put a default.ssp file in WEB-INF/layouts/default.ssp, it will 
automatically be used. In this case, you can simply call `ssp("/index")` and the
response will render within the default layout. 

To disable a layout for certain templates, Scalate accepts an empty `layout` 
attribute:

{pygmentize:: scala}
def get("/") {
  // This template will render without a layout.
  jade("/index", "layout" -> "", "foo" -> "uno", "bar" -> "dos")
}
{pygmentize}

Your layout file itself might look something like this:

{pygmentize:: html}
<%@ var body: String %>
<%@ var title: String = "Some Default Title" %>
<html>
<head>
  <title>${title}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>layout header goes here...</p>

  ${unescape(body)}

  <p>layout footer goes here...</p>
</body>
</html>
{pygmentize}

In this layout, the template output for the current action will be inserted
at the `${unescape(body)}` directive. 


### The `notFound` method

Error handlers run within the same context as routes and before filters.

Whenever no route matches, the `notFound` handler is invoked.  The default 
behavior is:

{pygmentize:: scala}
notFound {
  <h1>Not found. Bummer.</h1>
}
{pygmentize}

* _ScalatraServlet_: send a 404 response
* _ScalatraFilter_: pass the request to the servlet filter chain

You may need to render some other page when Scalatra can't find a route. 

Using Scalate directly:

{pygmentize:: scala}
class MyScalatraFilter extends ScalatraFilter with ScalateSupport {
  notFound {
    // If no route matches, then try to render a Scaml template
    val templateBase = requestPath match {
      case s if s.endsWith("/") => s + "index"
      case s => s
    }
    val templatePath = "/WEB-INF/scalate/templates/" + templateBase + ".scaml"
    servletContext.getResource(templatePath) match {
      case url: URL => 
        contentType = "text/html"
        templateEngine.layout(templatePath)
      case _ => 
        filterChain.doFilter(request, response)
    } 
  }
}
{pygmentize}

Or more simply, using the Scalate helpers:

{pygmentize:: scala}
notFound {
  findTemplate(requestPath) map { path =>
    contentType = "text/html"
    layoutTemplate(path)
  } orElse serveStaticResource() getOrElse resourceNotFound() 
}
{pygmentize}
